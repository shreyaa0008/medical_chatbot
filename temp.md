INFO:__main__:Processed response from llama11b API : The encoder in the image consists of the following components:

1.  **Input Embedding**: This is where the input data is embedded into a higher-dimensional space to prepare it for processing by the model.
2.  **Positional Encoding**: This component adds positional information to the input embeddings, which helps the model understand the order and relationships between different parts of the input sequence.
3.  **Nx Encoder Blocks**: The encoder consists of a series of identical layers, each of which comprises two sub-layers: 

    *   **Multi-Head Attention**: This sub-layer allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously and weigh their importance. It consists of multiple attention heads that work together to capture different types of relationships between the input elements.
    *   **Feed Forward**: This sub-layer is a fully connected feed-forward network that transforms the output from the multi-head attention sub-layer.
    *   **Add & Norm**: This sub-layer performs element-wise addition and layer normalization to stabilize the training process and improve the model's performance.

These components work together to transform the input sequence into a continuous representation that captures its semantic meaning and structural information. The output of the encoder is then passed to the decoder, which generates the output sequence based on this representation.

In the image, there are Nx Encoder blocks. Therefore, the encoders in the picture are:

*   Multi-Head Attention
*   Feed Forward
*   Add & Norm
*   Input Embedding
*   Positional Encoding
INFO:__main__:Processed response from llama90b API : The encoders in this picture are:

*   **Multi-Head Attention**
*   **Feed Forward**
*   **Add & Norm**

These three components are repeated N times in the encoder. The encoder takes in input embeddings and outputs a sequence of vectors that can be used by the decoder to generate output probabilities.

The **Add & Norm** component is used for residual connection and layer normalization. The **Multi-Head Attention** component allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously and weigh their importance. The **Feed Forward** component is a fully connected feed-forward network that transforms the output of the multi-head attention mechanism.
